**Studentliving Gothenburg** is a mobile app for android with the purpose of making it easier for students to find accommodation in Gothenburg.
It pulls data from the two largest student housing providers in Gothenburg and makes it easily searchable. 
There's also some more advanced features such as favouriting or creating searches running in the background sending notifications when new matches are found.

## How to install

There's two ways to install Studentliving Gothenburg. 
* Downloading the apk file in the projects root and [installing it on an android device](http://www.wikihow.tech/Install-APK-Files-on-Android). 
* Cloning this repo and running it through android studios, either in an emulator or on an android device.

Running the app on an actual android device is prefered over running it on an emulator as there are some bugs when running in an emulator.
